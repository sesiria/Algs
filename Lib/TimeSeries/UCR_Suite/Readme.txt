== Readme ==
This readme briefly explains how to use the codes. Our DTW code requires four parameters in this syntax: 	
    UCR_DTW   Data_File  Query_File  M   R		 
    or
    UCR_ED    Data_File  Query_File  M   
		 
Input Explanation,
    UCR_DTW (or UCR_ED):  the executable file of our algorithm
    Data_File:  the data file containing a long time series
    Query_File: the query file containing the query, Q
    M:  length of the query time series. It usually is |Q|, but can be smaller.
    R:  size of warping windows. The value is in range 0-1, e.g., R=0.05 means windows of size +/-5%. 	

Output Explanation,
    Location: starting location of the nearest neighbor of the given query, of size M, in the data file. Note that location starts from 0.
	Distance: the distance between the nearest neighbor and the query.
	Data Scaned: number of data in the input data file.
	Pruned by LB: the number of subsequence can be prunned by using that LB (in percentage).
	DTW Calculation: the number DTW calculation has been made in total.
	Note that, when approximate one million data points have been read, one dot "." will be displayed on screen (only in UCR_DTW).
